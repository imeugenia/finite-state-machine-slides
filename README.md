# State machine pattern in FE development

## Description

State management is a hard problem in applications not only on a global but also on the UI component level. It happens that components are over-stacked with boolean variables like `isLoading` , `isError`, and so on. That makes logic convoluted and easy to cause a bug.
This talk is for front-end developers who want to try shifting their state management paradigm. You will learn about a finite state machine pattern, and how to draw and program a state chart using vanilla JavaScript. By the end of the talk, you will understand how to implement the UI component state in a more clean and bug-free way.
